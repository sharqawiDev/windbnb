<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](preview.png)

TODO App with simple functionality like add, change todo state (complete or no), and delete for one todo of all of the list.

- The app is available for all internet users right from the 'Domain' button above.
- Building this app was somehow easy but it took some time since I don't use templates or pre-made components.
- With this project, I learned some key concepts in react like state management and using SVG correctly.
